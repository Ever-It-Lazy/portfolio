The purpose of this site is simply to centralizing my various demos, like a resume.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). There is nothing particular to the Next.js framework in the app, however: it's a completely static app.  There's not even a database.

I did took the opportunity to experiment with Tailwind CSS and got pretty flashy with the design.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `out` folder.

### `npm start`

When in production, starts the app.

## Deploy

CI/CD is controlled by the host site Render.  So commits to the `main` branch are automatically deployed.
