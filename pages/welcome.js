				My name is Everett Lindsay. I'm a full stack web developer.
				For the past 20 years I've used my Washington, DC location to
				mostly serve as a government contractor. But as positions
				have become increasingly remote, my interest has turned
				toward pure JavaScript stacks.
				</p>
				<p>
				Most of my contracting work is private, involving some level
				of clearance. But I forged a favorable reputation across the
				various teams I've participated in, and I'd eagerly pass on
				my references.

				<p>
				Let these demonstrations serve as evidence of my toolkit.
