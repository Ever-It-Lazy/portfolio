					My name is Everett Lindsay. I'm a full stack web developer.
					For the past 20 years I've mostly served as a government
					contractor in the Washington DC market. As remote positions
					have become increasingly viable, my interest has shifted
					toward industry advances that the government is too
					bureaucratic to keep pace with.
				</p>
				<p className="mb-4">
					The majority of my career involved some level of clearance,
					leaving me with an anemic public face. But my
					references reach across a myriad of organizations, as I've
					made concerted effort to leave my mark and not burn bridges
					in my wake. Please, ask: I'd eagerly pass them on.
				</p>
				<p className="mb-4">
					In demonstration of how my abilities might serve your company,
					I present a few of my more recent experiments.
