				<p>
					My name is Everett Lindsay. I've been living in Washington DC
					for the past 20 years, working as a fullstack web developer.
				</p>
				<p>
					The government is slow to adopt new technologies.
					Meanwhile, the trend toward	remote work has opened doors for
					individuals like me, grounded in location but curious
					to explore the industry's advances.
				</p>
				<p>
					The majority of my career involved some level of clearance,
					leaving me with an anemic public presence. Showcasing my
					sandbox experiments here helps demonstrate how my abilities
					could translate to your organization. For a real world
					sense of my performance, I encourage requesting my career,
					and I've made concerted effort to not burn bridges. Don't just
					take my word for it: let my former bosses tell you what you're
					missing.
