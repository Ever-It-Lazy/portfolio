					My name is Everett Lindsay. I've been living in Washington DC
					for the past 20 years, working as a fullstack web developer.
				</p>
				<p>
					The government is slow to adopt new technologies.
					Meanwhile, the trend toward	remote work has opened doors for
					individuals like me, grounded in location but curious
					to explore the industry's advances.
				</p>
				<p>
					My profile is svelt: the majority of my career
					has involved some level of clearance, leaving little to
					publicize. I showcase my sandbox experiments here to
					demonstrate how my knowledge of React could translate to your
					organization. For a real world sense of my performance, I
					encourage requesting my references, as I've made concerted
					effort to not burn bridges. Don't just take my word for it:
					let my former employers tell you what you're missing.
